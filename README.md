# Cross-Device-Personalized-Federated-Multi-Armed-Bandits
Movie Recommendation System with cross-device PFMAB
By combining the Multi Armed Bandit problem with cross-device federated learning, we have extended the PF-UCB method proposed in [1] to take a more realistic approach. Many new concepts are introduced in the framework, as well as their use in real-world applications. e novel extension’s performance is measured using non-IID, real-world movie ratings - Dataset MovieLens. e analysis shows that the change does actually enhance large-scale client engagement and customer sampling. Furthermore, our ndings open the way for new research avenues in this eld, such as adding noise to the rewards for dierential privacy and dropping lagging clients to save computation time. The cross-device FL extension can be applied to the proposed algorithm improvements in the paper. In addition,client sampling method can be improved and a thorough theoretical analysis must be undertaken to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed extension
